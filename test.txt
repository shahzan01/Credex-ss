Objective
Build a responsive, single-page marketing website for a fictional software resale startup.
This assignment checks your ability to quickly ship a usable product with clean code, relevant content, and good design instincts.

Your Task
Build a 1-page responsive website for a fictional company called 'SoftSell' that includes:

Hero Section – Headline and subheading (you write it), CTA button (e.g., “Get a Quote”, “Sell My Licenses”)

How It Works – Three steps: e.g., Upload License → Get Valuation → Get Paid. Icons or visuals preferred

Why Choose Us – 3–4 bullet points or tiles with icons and small descriptions

Customer Testimonials – Add 2 dummy reviews (name, role, company)

Contact / Lead Form – Name, Email, Company, License Type (dropdown), Message (frontend validation only)

UI/UX Expectations
Visually appealing and modern

Use Tailwind, Bootstrap, or custom styles

Mobile responsive layout

Coherent color palette and font family

Tech Guidelines
Use React.js + Vite or Next.js

Host on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

Use dummy data, no backend needed

Include a README.md with features implemented, design choices, and time spent

Bonus Points
Logo placeholder or favicon

SEO meta tags and page title

Light/dark mode toggle

Use of animations (e.g., Framer Motion)


Bonus: LLM-Powered Chat Feature
Add a basic AI-powered customer chat widget.

Use an open-source wrapper like Langchain or OpenAI API

Hardcode example questions (e.g., 'How do I sell my license?')

LLM can be mocked or real (free-tier OpenAI key)

Evaluation:

Clean UI integration

Intuitive chat UX

Clear prompts and fallback responses

Deliverables
GitHub repo link (public or invite access)

Live URL (hosted site)
